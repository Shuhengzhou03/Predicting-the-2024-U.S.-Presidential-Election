Our models predict that Kamala Harris is likely to lead with an average support of 47.34%, with her support positively correlated with higher transparency scores among pollsters. In contrast, Donald Trumpâ€™s support remains relatively stable across poll transparency levels. State-level predictions highlight close competition in pivotal swing states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, underscoring their decisive influence on the election outcome. This analysis demonstrates how transparency and geographic factors shape voter sentiment, offering insights to inform future election forecasting.'\n  bibliography:\n    - references.bib\n  \n"]
